%section#story
  %article
    %p
      <em>Bert: The Emotion Picture</em> tells the story of Bert (Andre Meadows), a socially awkward and isolated man
      who desperately wants the attention of Sara (Jeneta St. Clair), the girl of his dreams. When he sees
      that Sara is consumed with a handsome stranger (Morgan Benoit), Bert becomes obsessed with being just like him.
      Against the backdrop of Los Angeles, the ultimate land of artifice, Bert receives enlightenment through
      a public access TV show that urges viewers to be themselves, but to also demand gifts from the Universe.
      Bert looks in the mirror and wants desperately to become visible to Sara and, ultimately, the world.
      After a chance meeting with a mysterious man named Louis (David Atwood), Bert suddenly feels capable of
      manifesting his most impossible desire to switch bodies with the beautiful stranger.
    %p
      After the transformation, Bert walks away in his new body and the stranger wakes confused and trapped in Bert’s body.
      The question remains, however, if Bert can ultimately transcend his (or anyone else’s) skin.
    %p
      Also starring Myko Olivier and Erin Konstantine, <em>Bert: The Emotion Picture</em> is a surreal fable about the
      nature of love and superficiality.

          A native San Franciscan of Peruvian and Salvadorean descent,
          Jose Montesinos has been making movies since he received his first video
          camera at age 14.  He continued to hone his skills through the years,
          and also attended film school at San Francisco City College in
          the early 1990's.  In 2009, Jose was awarded the Mastermind grant
          from the SF Weekly for being recognized as a standout local talent.
          Jose’s feature-length crime drama titled Owned was an official selection
          in several film festivals, including HBO’s New York International Latino
          Film Festival, and has since found a distribution deal with Maverick
          Entertainment. It was released in July 2011.

          Morgan Benoit has been involved in Chinese martial arts for over 15 years.
          Following his passion, he moved to China at age 18 to study at the Beijing Sports University where he mastered Long Fist Kung Fu.
          Once ascending to the top of his class in just a couple of years, he was admitted to the prestigious Shi Cha Hai Sports Academy,
          a former training ground of Jet Li and many of China's top Olympic athletes.
          His love of martial arts led to his interest in acting and he started in China as a stunt man.
          He eventually worked his way up to leading roles in many Chinese and American productions.
          His ability and enthusiasm was well-noted by Jackie Chan whom he worked with in The Forbidden Kingdom (2008).
