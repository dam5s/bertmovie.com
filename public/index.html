                    <em>Bert: The Emotion Picture</em> tells the story of Bert (Andre Meadows), a socially awkward and
                    isolated man
                    who desperately wants the attention of Sara (Jeneta St. Clair), the girl of his dreams. When he sees
                    that Sara is consumed with a handsome stranger (Morgan Benoit), Bert becomes obsessed with being just
                    like him.
                    Against the backdrop of Los Angeles, the ultimate land of artifice, Bert receives enlightenment through
                    a public access TV show that urges viewers to be themselves, but to also demand gifts from the Universe.
                    Bert looks in the mirror and wants desperately to become visible to Sara and, ultimately, the world.
                    After a chance meeting with a mysterious man named Louis (David Atwood), Bert suddenly feels capable of
                    manifesting his most impossible desire to switch bodies with the beautiful stranger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the transformation, Bert walks away in his new body and the stranger wakes confused and trapped in
                    Bert’s body.
                    The question remains, however, if Bert can ultimately transcend his (or anyone else’s) skin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also starring Myko Olivier and Erin Konstantine, <em>Bert: The Emotion Picture</em> is a surreal fable
                    about the
                    nature of love and superficiality.

                            But it's safe to say that Adam's sensibilities aren't so much &ldquo;The Little Match

                            And his philosophy is less informed by existentialism as by, &ldquo;Late Night with Conan
                            O'Brian.&rdquo;
                            Adam earned his degree in Graphic Design and Advertising, then a BA in Multimedia Design and

                            During her time at Tisch, Adler Technique and Shakespeare were strong focuses in her training
                            for three years,
